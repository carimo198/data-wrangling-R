This repository is a demonstration of data wrangling with R. Common data cleaning and preprocessing tasks will be explored by locating open data from the web, import it into R, apply tidy data principles on the data and manipulate the data appropriately. The 'wh_staff_dataset.csv' contains the complete White House staff salary data from 1997-2020. Refer to the [project page](https://carimo198.github.io/data-wrangling-R/) for further information and detailed explanation of the techniques used.
